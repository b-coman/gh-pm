# [AI Features] Proactive Recommendations

## Overview
Enhance the recommendation system to proactively analyze project state and provide intelligent, context-aware suggestions for next actions. This goes beyond the current basic recommendations to include project pattern analysis, bottleneck detection, and workflow optimization suggestions.

## Task Classification
- **Type**: Enhancement
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Effort**: Large
- **Dependencies**: foundation-003 (test suite for AI feature validation), current recommendation system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Advanced project state analysis engine
- [ ] Pattern recognition for common project workflows
- [ ] Bottleneck and blocking issue detection
- [ ] Timeline prediction and milestone analysis
- [ ] Risk assessment for task dependencies
- [ ] Workload balancing recommendations
- [ ] Performance optimization suggestions
- [ ] Historical project data analysis
- [ ] Custom recommendation rules engine
- [ ] A/B testing framework for recommendation quality
- [ ] Machine learning model integration (optional)

## Technical Specification

### Enhanced Recommendation Engine
```bash
./github-pm recommend [--context=<context>] [--depth=<analysis_depth>] [--format=json]

# Context options:
# - project_start: Initial project setup
# - development: Active development phase
# - integration: Integration and testing phase
# - deployment: Deployment preparation
# - maintenance: Ongoing maintenance

# Depth options:
# - quick: Basic recommendations (current behavior)
# - detailed: Comprehensive analysis
# - predictive: Future-looking analysis with predictions
```

### Analysis Components

#### 1. Project State Analysis
```json
{
  "project_health": {
    "status": "healthy|at_risk|critical",
    "score": 85,
    "factors": {
      "dependency_health": "good",
      "task_distribution": "balanced",
      "progress_velocity": "on_track",
      "risk_level": "low"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Pattern Recognition
```json
{
  "recognized_patterns": [
    {
      "pattern": "sequential_foundation_work",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "recommendation": "Continue with foundation tasks before starting features",
      "evidence": ["All foundation tasks in progress", "No feature work started"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Bottleneck Detection
```json
{
  "bottlenecks": [
    {
      "type": "dependency_chain",
      "blocking_task": "#42",
      "blocked_tasks": ["#45", "#46", "#47"],
      "impact": "high",
      "suggestion": "Consider parallel work on independent features"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4. Timeline Predictions
```json
{
  "timeline_analysis": {
    "current_velocity": "2.3 tasks/week",
    "predicted_completion": "2024-12-20",
    "confidence": 0.78,
    "risk_factors": ["Holiday period", "Dependency on external team"],
    "acceleration_opportunities": ["Parallel feature development", "Early QA involvement"]
  }
}
```

### Recommendation Categories

#### 1. Immediate Actions (High Priority)
- Tasks ready to start now
- Urgent dependency resolutions
- Critical path optimizations
- Risk mitigation actions

#### 2. Strategic Planning (Medium Priority)
- Resource allocation suggestions
- Milestone planning
- Risk assessment and contingencies
- Process improvements

#### 3. Optimization (Low Priority)
- Workflow efficiency improvements
- Tool and process recommendations
- Long-term project health
- Technical debt management

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Custom Rules Engine
```yaml
# .github-pm/recommendation-rules.yml
rules:
  - name: "Foundation First"
    condition: "foundation_tasks_incomplete"
    recommendation: "Complete foundation tasks before feature work"
    priority: "high"
    
  - name: "Parallel Work Opportunity"
    condition: "independent_tasks_available AND team_capacity > 1"
    recommendation: "Consider parallel development streams"
    priority: "medium"
```

#### 2. Learning from History
```json
{
  "historical_insights": {
    "similar_projects": 3,
    "average_completion_time": "6 weeks",
    "common_bottlenecks": ["Integration testing", "External dependencies"],
    "success_patterns": ["Early testing", "Regular stakeholder updates"]
  }
}
```

#### 3. Integration Suggestions
```json
{
  "integration_recommendations": [
    {
      "type": "ci_cd",
      "suggestion": "Set up automated testing for task #42",
      "rationale": "High-risk task with multiple dependencies",
      "implementation": "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Command Examples
```bash
# Quick recommendations (current functionality enhanced)
./github-pm recommend

# Detailed project analysis
./github-pm recommend --depth=detailed

# Context-specific recommendations
./github-pm recommend --context=development --depth=predictive

# Focus on specific areas
./github-pm recommend --focus=bottlenecks,timeline,risks

# Historical pattern analysis
./github-pm recommend --include-history --format=json
```

## Testing Strategy

### AI Feature Testing
- Test recommendation accuracy with known project states
- Validate pattern recognition against real project data
- Test prediction accuracy over time
- A/B testing for recommendation quality

### Edge Case Testing
- Empty projects
- Projects with complex dependency chains
- Projects with unusual patterns
- Error handling for incomplete data

### Performance Testing
- Large projects (100+ tasks)
- Complex dependency networks
- Real-time analysis performance
- Memory usage and optimization

## Documentation Impact
- Add AI features section to documentation
- Create recommendation interpretation guide
- Document custom rules configuration
- Add examples of common patterns and responses
