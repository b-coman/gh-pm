## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for GitHub Project Manager v1 features. Each feature is documented systematically with implementation details, usage patterns, and technical specifications.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Features

#### [Dry-Run System](./dry-run.md)
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Coverage**: 17/17 scripts (100%)  

Complete safety system enabling testing of all operations without making actual changes. Essential for AI assistant integration and safe development.

**Key Features**:
- Universal `--dry-run` support
- Mock data generation
- Safe API wrappers
- Visual indicators
- Zero write operations in dry-run mode

#### [Unified CLI Interface](./cli.md)
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Entry Point**: `gh-pm`  

Single, consistent entry point for all operations. Designed specifically for AI assistant compatibility with self-documenting features.

**Key Features**:
- Command delegation to individual scripts
- Built-in help system
- Predictable argument patterns
- Universal dry-run integration
- Command discovery

### Planned Documentation

#### [Shared Utilities](./shared-utilities.md)
**Status**: 📝 Planned  

Documentation of the shared utility system that enables consistent dry-run implementation across all scripts.

#### [Script Architecture](./script-architecture.md)
**Status**: 📝 Planned  

Technical details of how individual scripts are structured and enhanced with dry-run capability.

#### [AI Integration Patterns](./ai-integration.md)
**Status**: 📝 Planned  

Best practices and usage patterns for AI assistants like Claude Code.

#### [Configuration System](./configuration.md)
**Status**: 📝 Planned  

How the tool detects and adapts to different GitHub contexts and user configurations.

#### [Testing Framework](./testing.md)
**Status**: 📝 Planned  

Automated testing strategies for validating dry-run functionality and script behavior.

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- `feature-name.md` - Primary feature documentation
- Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word features
- Include version in content, not filename

### Content Structure
Each feature document follows this structure:

1. **Header** - Title, version, status
2. **Overview** - Brief description and purpose
3. **Architecture** - Technical implementation details
4. **Implementation** - Code examples and patterns
5. **Usage** - Examples and patterns
6. **Benefits** - Value proposition
7. **Future Considerations** - Planned improvements

### Status Indicators
- ✅ **Complete** - Fully implemented and documented
- 🔄 **In Progress** - Implementation underway
- 📝 **Planned** - Scheduled for future implementation
- ⚠️ **Issues** - Known problems or limitations
