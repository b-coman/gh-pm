## 📊 Project Execution Example

### Day 1: Project Initialization
```bash
# Check initial project status
./scripts/query-project-status.sh

# Output:
# 🎯 Vue 3 Migration Project Status
# 
# 📊 Current Status:
# ├── Ready: 3 tasks (#39, #40, #41)
# ├── In Progress: 0 tasks
# ├── Done: 0 tasks
# └── Blocked: 9 tasks (dependencies not met)
#
# 🚨 Critical Path Items:
# ├── #39: Vue 3 Compatibility Analysis (Foundation) - Ready
# ├── #40: Shared Component Inventory (Foundation) - Ready
# └── #41: State Management Architecture (Foundation) - Ready
#
# 💡 AI Recommendations:
# └── Start with #39 (Vue 3 Compatibility Analysis) - highest impact
```

### Day 1-3: Foundation Phase
```bash
# Start first foundation task
./scripts/start-task.sh 39

# AI assists with:
# - Analyzing existing Vue 2 components for compatibility
# - Identifying breaking changes and migration requirements
# - Documenting component dependencies and usage patterns
# - Creating compatibility matrix and migration priority list

# Complete first task
./scripts/complete-task.sh 39

# Check updated status
./scripts/query-project-status.sh

# Output shows #39 complete, other foundation tasks still available
```

### Day 4-6: Continue Foundation
```bash
# Start shared component inventory
./scripts/start-task.sh 40

# AI assists with:
# - Cataloging all shared components
# - Analyzing component props and event patterns
# - Identifying components requiring major refactoring
# - Creating migration priority based on usage frequency

./scripts/complete-task.sh 40

# Start state management analysis
./scripts/start-task.sh 41

# AI assists with:
# - Analyzing Vuex store structure
# - Planning migration to Pinia/Composition API
# - Identifying state dependencies and data flow
# - Designing new state architecture

./scripts/complete-task.sh 41
```

### Day 7: Foundation Complete, Enhancements Unblocked
```bash
# Check status after foundation completion
./scripts/query-project-status.sh

# Output:
# 🎯 Vue 3 Migration Project Status
# 
# 📊 Current Status:
# ├── Ready: 3 tasks (#42, #43, #44) ← Now unblocked!
# ├── In Progress: 0 tasks
# ├── Done: 3 tasks (#39, #40, #41)
# └── Blocked: 6 tasks (waiting for enhancements)
#
# 🚨 Critical Path Items:
# ├── #42: Component Migration Strategy (Enhancement) - Ready
# ├── #43: Composition API Integration (Enhancement) - Ready
# └── #44: State Management Migration (Enhancement) - Ready
#
# 💡 AI Recommendations:
# └── Start with #42 (Component Migration Strategy) - unlocks migration phase
```

### Week 2-4: Enhancement Phase
```bash
# Work through enhancement tasks sequentially
./scripts/start-task.sh 42

# AI assists with:
# - Creating step-by-step component migration process
# - Building automated migration tools and scripts
# - Implementing gradual migration strategy
# - Setting up testing framework for migrated components

./scripts/complete-task.sh 42
./scripts/start-task.sh 43

# Continue with Composition API integration and state management
```

### Week 5: Migration Phase
```bash
# After all enhancements complete, migration tasks become ready
./scripts/query-project-status.sh

# Output shows #45 and #46 ready to start
./scripts/start-task.sh 45

# AI assists with:
# - Executing production migration plan
# - Monitoring performance and error metrics
# - Rolling back if issues detected
# - Coordinating deployment across environments
```

### Week 6: QA and Documentation
```bash
# Final phase tasks become available
./scripts/start-task.sh 47  # Testing
./scripts/start-task.sh 49  # Documentation

# AI assists with:
# - Running comprehensive test suites
# - Performance benchmarking
# - Creating team training materials
# - Documenting lessons learned
```
