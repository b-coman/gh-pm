# [Developer Experience] Makefile & Development Scripts

## Overview
Create a comprehensive Makefile and development script suite that streamlines common development tasks, improves developer productivity, and establishes consistent workflows for contributors.

## Task Classification
- **Type**: Enhancement
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Effort**: Small
- **Dependencies**: foundation-003 (basic test suite)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Makefile created with standard targets
- [ ] `make install` - Install development dependencies and set up environment
- [ ] `make test` - Run complete test suite
- [ ] `make lint` - Code quality checks and formatting
- [ ] `make docs` - Generate/update documentation
- [ ] `make clean` - Clean build artifacts and temp files
- [ ] `make dev` - Set up development environment
- [ ] `make release` - Prepare release artifacts
- [ ] Development scripts in `scripts/dev/` directory
- [ ] Environment validation script
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks setup
- [ ] Documentation for all make targets

## Technical Specification

### Makefile Structure
```makefile
# GitHub Project AI Manager - Development Makefile

.PHONY: help install test lint docs clean dev release

# Default target
help:
	@echo "GitHub Project AI Manager - Development Commands"
	@echo ""
	@echo "Available targets:"
	@echo "  help     - Show this help message"
	@echo "  install  - Install development dependencies"
	@echo "  test     - Run test suite"
	@echo "  lint     - Run code quality checks"
	@echo "  docs     - Generate documentation"
	@echo "  clean    - Clean temporary files"
	@echo "  dev      - Set up development environment"
	@echo "  release  - Prepare release"

install:
	@echo "Installing development dependencies..."
	@scripts/dev/install-deps.sh

test:
	@echo "Running test suite..."
	@scripts/dev/run-tests.sh

lint:
	@echo "Running code quality checks..."
	@scripts/dev/lint.sh

docs:
	@echo "Generating documentation..."
	@scripts/dev/generate-docs.sh

clean:
	@echo "Cleaning temporary files..."
	@scripts/dev/clean.sh

dev:
	@echo "Setting up development environment..."
	@scripts/dev/setup-dev.sh

release:
	@echo "Preparing release..."
	@scripts/dev/prepare-release.sh
```

### Development Scripts

#### `scripts/dev/install-deps.sh`
- Install required system dependencies
- Validate GitHub CLI installation
- Set up test environment
- Install development tools (linters, etc.)

#### `scripts/dev/run-tests.sh`
- Execute full test suite
- Generate test reports
- Check test coverage
- Return appropriate exit codes

#### `scripts/dev/lint.sh`
- Shell script linting (shellcheck)
- Documentation linting (markdownlint)
- JSON validation
- Code style consistency checks

#### `scripts/dev/setup-dev.sh`
- Create development project for testing
- Set up git hooks
- Configure development environment
- Validate setup with health check

#### `scripts/dev/prepare-release.sh`
- Version validation
- Changelog generation
- Release notes preparation
- Archive creation

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "Running pre-commit checks..."

# Run linting
make lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Linting failed. Fix issues before committing."
    exit 1
fi

# Run tests
make test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Tests failed. Fix issues before committing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pre-commit checks passed."
```

## Testing Strategy
- Test all make targets in clean environment
- Validate cross-platform compatibility
- Test with various system configurations
- Verify error handling in development scripts

## Documentation Impact
- Add development section to CONTRIBUTING.md
- Document all make targets and their purpose
- Create development setup guide
- Add troubleshooting for common dev issues

## Implementation Notes
- Keep Makefile simple and portable
- Use shell scripts for complex logic
- Provide clear error messages
- Fast execution of common tasks
- Integrate with existing project structure
