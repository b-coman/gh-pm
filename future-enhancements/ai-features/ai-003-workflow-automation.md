# [AI Features] Workflow Automation

## Overview
Implement intelligent workflow automation that can learn from project patterns and automatically execute routine tasks, suggest workflow optimizations, and orchestrate complex multi-step operations based on project context and historical data.

## Task Classification
- **Type**: Enhancement
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Effort**: Large
- **Dependencies**: ai-001 (proactive recommendations), ai-002 (task explanation for workflow context)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated task state transitions based on conditions
- [ ] Custom workflow definition and execution
- [ ] Pattern-based automation suggestions
- [ ] Safe automation with rollback capabilities
- [ ] Workflow performance monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Integration with external systems (CI/CD, notifications)
- [ ] Rule-based and ML-driven automation options
- [ ] Comprehensive audit trail for automated actions
- [ ] User approval workflows for sensitive operations
- [ ] Workflow templates for common project patterns

## Technical Specification

### Workflow Definition Format
```yaml
# .github-pm/workflows/foundation-complete.yml
name: "Foundation Phase Completion"
trigger:
  conditions:
    - all_foundation_tasks_done: true
    - no_blocking_issues: true
  
automation:
  - action: "update_project_phase"
    params:
      phase: "development"
      
  - action: "notify_team"
    params:
      message: "Foundation phase complete, development can begin"
      channels: ["slack", "email"]
      
  - action: "create_milestone"
    params:
      title: "Development Phase Start"
      due_date: "+7 days"
      
  - action: "suggest_next_tasks"
    params:
      type: "enhancement"
      priority: "high"
```

### Command Interface
```bash
# Workflow management
./github-pm workflow list
./github-pm workflow enable <workflow_name>
./github-pm workflow disable <workflow_name>
./github-pm workflow run <workflow_name> [--dry-run]

# Automation discovery
./github-pm workflow suggest --context=current
./github-pm workflow analyze --project-patterns

# Manual workflow execution
./github-pm workflow execute foundation-complete --confirm
```

### Automation Engine

{
  "automation_capabilities": {
    "task_management": [
      "auto_assign_ready_tasks",

### Intelligent Pattern Recognition
```json
{
  "pattern_examples": [
    {
      "pattern": "sequential_dependency_completion",
      "description": "When task A completes, automatically start task B if dependencies are met",
      "automation": {
        "trigger": "task_completed",
        "condition": "all_dependencies_satisfied",
        "action": "auto_start_dependent_tasks"
      }
    },
    {
      "pattern": "feature_branch_workflow",
      "description": "Automatically create feature branches for new enhancement tasks",
      "automation": {
        "trigger": "task_assigned",
        "condition": "task_type == 'enhancement'",
        "action": "create_feature_branch"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Safety and Control Features

      "high_risk_actions": ["delete_tasks", "modify_milestones", "reassign_critical_tasks"],
      "approval_required": true,
      "approvers": ["project_owner", "team_lead"]
    },
    "rollback_capabilities": {
      "action_history": "full_audit_trail",
      "rollback_timeframe": "24_hours",
      "automated_rollback_triggers": ["error_threshold_exceeded", "user_request"]
    },
    "rate_limiting": {
      "max_actions_per_hour": 50,
      "burst_protection": true,
      "cooldown_periods": "configurable"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy
- Test workflow execution with various project scenarios
- Validate safety mechanisms and rollback procedures
- Test pattern recognition accuracy
- Performance testing with complex workflows
- Integration testing with external systems

## Documentation Impact
- Add workflow automation guide to main documentation
- Create workflow template library
- Document safety best practices
- Add troubleshooting guide for automation issues

## Implementation Notes
- Start with simple rule-based automation
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Design for extensibility and custom integrations
- Prioritize safety and user control over automation speed
