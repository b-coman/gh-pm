## 📋 Methodology Framework

### Project Structure Design

#### Issue Taxonomy with AI Control
```
Foundation Tasks (Critical Path - AI ensures these start first)
├── Component Analysis (#39) → Ready immediately
├── Shared Components (#40) → Ready immediately  
└── Core Architecture (#41) → Ready immediately

Enhancement Tasks (AI blocks until foundation complete)
├── Property Pages (#42) → Blocked by #39, #40, #41
├── Theme Integration (#43) → Blocked by #39, #40, #41
└── Booking Forms (#44) → Blocked by #39, #40, #41

Migration Tasks (AI blocks until enhancements ready)
├── System Migration (#45) → Blocked by #42, #43, #44
└── Legacy Cleanup (#46) → Blocked by #45

Quality Assurance (AI coordinates with enhancements)
├── Testing Strategy (#47) → Unblocked after #42, #43, #44
└── Performance (#48) → Unblocked after #42, #43, #44

Documentation (AI manages final phase)
├── Architecture Docs (#49) → Unblocked after #45, #46
└── Migration Guide (#50) → Unblocked after #45, #46
```

#### Custom Fields for AI Management
- **Task Type**: Foundation/Enhancement/Migration/QA/Documentation
- **Risk Level**: Critical/High/Medium/Low (drives AI prioritization)
- **Effort**: Small (1-2 days)/Medium (3-5 days)/Large (1+ weeks)
- **Dependencies**: Text field mapping prerequisite relationships
- **Status**: Backlog/Ready/In Progress/Review/Done (AI controlled)

#### Dependency Mapping Strategy
```markdown
**Explicit Dependencies Format**:
- Text field: "#39, #40, #41" (prerequisite issue numbers)
- AI parsing: Converts to programmatic dependency checks
- Validation: AI prevents progression until all dependencies "Done"
- Automation: Completing tasks triggers dependent task readiness checks

**Dependency Types**:
- **Sequential**: Task B cannot start until Task A completes
- **Parallel**: Tasks can run simultaneously but share prerequisites
- **Conditional**: Tasks become ready based on specific completion criteria
- **Milestone**: Groups of tasks that unlock subsequent phases
```

### AI-Driven Automation Framework

#### Workflow Scripts Overview

| Script | Purpose | AI Integration |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `setup-complete-github-project.sh` | Complete project setup | Creates all infrastructure |
| `query-project-status.sh` | Real-time dashboard | Status monitoring and reporting |
| `check-dependencies.sh` | Dependency analysis | Task readiness evaluation |
| `start-task.sh [issue-number]` | Begin task workflow | Validation and state transition |
| `complete-task.sh [issue-number]` | Complete with validation | AC verification and unblocking |
| `move-to-ready.sh [issue-number]` | Manual task unblocking | Override for special cases |

#### AI Decision Engine Logic

```python
class AIWorkflowEngine:
    def can_move_to_ready(self, task):
        """Validate all prerequisites complete"""
        return all(
            dependency.status == "Done" 
            for dependency in task.dependencies
        )
    
    def start_task(self, task_id):
        """Begin task with validation"""
        task = self.get_task(task_id)
        if (task.status == "Ready" and 
            not self.has_active_task() and
            self.validate_prerequisites(task)):
            self.move_to_status(task_id, "In Progress")
            self.log_task_start(task_id)
            return True
        return False
    
    def complete_task(self, task_id):
        """Complete with acceptance criteria validation"""
        if self.validate_acceptance_criteria(task_id):
            self.move_to_status(task_id, "Done")
            self.check_dependent_tasks(task_id)
            self.update_project_metrics(task_id)
            return True
        return False
    
    def enforce_single_task_focus(self):
        """Ensure only one task active at a time"""
        active_tasks = self.get_tasks_by_status("In Progress")
        return len(active_tasks) <= 1
```

## 🔄 Workflow Implementation

### Project Board States with AI Control

```
Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Review → Done
    │       │         │          │       │
    ▼       ▼         ▼          ▼       ▼
Not yet   Can       Currently   Awaits  Complete
started   begin     active      review  & tested
```

**AI State Transition Rules**:
- **Backlog → Ready**: All dependencies must be "Done"
- **Ready → In Progress**: Only one task active, prerequisites validated
- **In Progress → Review**: Acceptance criteria completion verified
- **Review → Done**: Quality gates passed, documentation updated
- **Automatic Unblocking**: Completion triggers dependent task analysis

### Project Setup Automation
