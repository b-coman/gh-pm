## 🏗️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required tools
brew install gh jq  # macOS
# or: sudo apt install gh jq  # Ubuntu

# GitHub authentication with project permissions
gh auth refresh -s project,read:project --hostname github.com
```

### Development Environment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-project-ai-manager.git
cd github-project-ai-manager

# Create a test repository for development
gh repo create test-project-ai-manager --private

# Test the setup
./scripts/setup-complete-github-project.sh
```

### Testing Changes
```bash
# Test script modifications
bash -x ./scripts/your-modified-script.sh

# Validate GraphQL queries
gh api graphql -f query='your query here'

# Test error handling
# (Intentionally cause errors to verify graceful handling)
```

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

#### Shell Script Guidelines
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script header with clear description
# Author, date, and purpose

set -e  # Exit on error
set -u  # Exit on undefined variables

# Use meaningful variable names
PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
ISSUE_NUMBER="42"

# Include error handling
if ! command -v gh &> /dev/null; then
    echo "❌ GitHub CLI not found. Please install: brew install gh"
    exit 1
fi

# Use functions for reusable code
validate_prerequisites() {
    # Validation logic here
}

# Clear output formatting
echo "✅ Success message"
echo "❌ Error message"  
echo "ℹ️  Information message"
echo "💡 Suggestion message"
```

#### GraphQL Query Standards
```bash
# Use heredoc for multi-line queries
QUERY=$(cat <<'EOF'
query GetProjectStatus($login: String!, $number: Int!) {
  user(login: $login) {
    projectV2(number: $number) {
      id
      title
      items(first: 50) {
        nodes {
          id
          content {
            ... on Issue {
              number
              title
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
)

# Execute with proper error handling
if ! response=$(gh api graphql -f query="$QUERY" -f login="$USER" -f number="$PROJECT_NUMBER"); then
    echo "❌ Failed to query project status"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### Documentation Standards
```markdown
# Use clear headings and structure
## Section Title
### Subsection Title

# Include code examples with syntax highlighting
```bash
./scripts/example-command.sh
```

# Add practical examples
**Example**: Setting up a React migration project
```bash
# Step-by-step instructions here
```

# Use emoji for visual clarity (sparingly)
✅ Success indicators
❌ Error indicators  
ℹ️ Information
💡 Tips and suggestions
🚀 New features
```
